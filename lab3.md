Researching Commands
I chose to look more into the `grep` command.
After researching this command I found it is useful to search texting patterns in files.
`r` (`recessive`) - Allows you to search for a pattern recursively in a directory and its subdirectories.
Here is an example of using it. 

`$ grep -r "pattern" ./technical
./technical/file1.txt:This is a pattern example.
./technical/subdir/file2.txt:Another pattern instance.`
